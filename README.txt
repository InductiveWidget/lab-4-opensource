I fixed a bad sentence for a manuel page of the FreeBSD website.  Good documentation is important because it allows a project/code/opensource software to be reachable and understandable by as large of an audience as possible.  Projects that are documented are more likely to be used as they were intended and attract more developers to its cause and purpose.  Maintaining documentation/ porting it to other languages creates a reciprocal relationship between contributors and administrators.  I learned how to grab parts of documentation from the web and how to then search through all the directories to find and fix errors.  I also learned about the bug/ticket system as well by submitting my own fix.  

Five reasons for opensource would be:
1. many eyes will make bugs shallow, easy to find and fix
2. allows the user to edit and modify and include their own code/libraries for whatever reason they want
3. prevents the problem of vendor lockin, certain companies will make customers pay for updates and support because they can, no other choice
4. prevents abandonware, if the original owners decide to scrap the project, then that code is unable to be updated/maintained, likely become unusable in the future
5. allows software/project to be easily crossplatform with motitvated developers

Five reasons for proprietary would be:
1. developers/companies need to make money too, supports workers, businesses, and investors, stuff in this world is not free(yet)
2. People or businesses who become rich off of software can later go on to do great things for humanitarian purposes, more good than is perceptionally percieved by an open software project
3. some opensource communities are hostile, hard to get along with, not always preferable alternative to a proprietary team and project
4. sometimes very spectial purpose software, like stockmarket software, or weather simulation, or chemical reaction simulation requires alot of upfront costs, or specialized kinds of programming can only initially be tackled by businesses and univerities with the will and need for such software. an opensource community may not always have a dedicated and specialized full time team for such software development
5. easier for government or shadier bodies to place sophisticated backdoors/bug into opensource software, need a clever and security minded project administration to combat such abuse, whereas proprietary has a layer of mystery for its security

For doing a side project I would probably want to learn about a certain language or learn about using specific libraries.  I would want this to be opensource since the help from larger community would make my learning an understaning of a topic much easier and more in depth.  Any bugs/mistakes would be easily taken care of.  On the other hand if I was starting a company then I would prefer a proprietary approach.  I would have the resources necessary to support a development team and I would have a reason to sell my ideas and products to the commercial market.  Being proprietary would ensure that competitors would not an easy time replicating the capabilities of my software.  It would ensure plenty of competition.
